    "## 1.Remove one of the correlated features: This is the simplest way to handle multicollinearity, but it can be wasteful if the correlated features are both important.\n",
    "## 2.Variance inflation factor (VIF): The VIF is a measure of how much the variance of a feature is inflated by the presence of other correlated features.\n",
    "##    A VIF of 1 indicates no multicollinearity, while a VIF of 10 or more indicates severe multicollinearity.\n",
