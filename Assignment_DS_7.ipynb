    "- Use a cloud-based platform with pay-as-you-go pricing: Cloud-based platforms, such as Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services, offer pay-as-you-go pricing, which means that you only pay for the resources that you use. This can help to reduce costs, especially if your project is not using a lot of resources.\n",
    "- Use spot instances: Spot instances are unused compute capacity that is offered at a discounted price. This can be a great way to save money on compute costs, especially if your project is flexible and can be run on spot instances.\n",
    "- Use preemptible instances: Preemptible instances are similar to spot instances, but they can be terminated at any time. This means that they are even cheaper than spot instances, but they are also less reliable.\n",
    "- Use managed machine learning services: Managed machine learning services, such as Google Cloud AutoML and Amazon SageMaker, can help to reduce the cost of machine learning. This is because these services take care of the infrastructure and the underlying machine learning frameworks, so you can focus on building and deploying your models.\n",
    "- Use autoscalers: Autoscalers can help to automatically scale your cloud resources up or down based on demand. This can help to ensure that you are only using the resources that you need, which can save you money.\n",
